Paged.js is a free and open source JavaScript library that paginates content in the browser to create PDF output from any HTML content. Following the Paged Media standards published by the W3C (ie the Paged Media Module, and the Generated Content for Paged Media Module), Paged.js acts as a polyfill for the CSS modules to print content in ways that are not normally supported by browsers.

## Paged.js

After years of trying a lot of solutions to make books out of HTML, and frustrated by the issues we found with each one of them, we ended up by building one of our own, following some mandatory principles.

1. We’ll follow the standards of the W3C. Standards is in the DNA of what we’re doing. If we want to add some feature, we'll write down the specifications and discuss with all the members of the W3C to see how it would make sense for them and we are open to anyone who want to share their thoughs. This project will be over when we’ll be happy with the browsers’ implementation of the W3C specification for print.
2. We’ll always put the community needs first: we have a [mattermost](https://mattermost.pagedmedia.org) that we use to discuss. The whole development is available through our [gitlab](https://gitlab.pagedmedia.org) and the issues are all read and answered as fast as possible.
3. Paged.js comes either as a paginated preview or as a command line interface (<small>CLI</small>) to produce the pdf.
4. Paged.js being a community driven project, we’ll make sure that the anyone feels just like at home, newcomers and old friends alike. To be sure that everyone is on the same page here, we’ll refer to the Contributor Convenant’s [Code of conduct]({{< ref "/code-of-conduct.md" >}}).

That said, we’re happy that you found us, and welcome around :)

Paged.js was founded by [Adam Hyde](https://www.adamhyde.net) and is currently developed by [Julie Blanc](http://julie-blanc.fr), [Fred Chasen](http://fchasen.com/) and Julien Taquet at the [Cabbage Tree Labs](https://www.cabbagetreelabs.org). 

Paged.js logo was designed by the lovely [Anton Moglia](http://moglia.fr/) and our own awesome [Julie Blanc](http://julie-blanc.fr) in a train back from this 60 years old type design event called [Les Rencontres de Lure](http://delure.org). 
Paged.js website was designed and built by [Adam Hyde](https://www.adamhyde.net) and Julien Taquet thanks to the great static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

<!-- Minipax, the extraordinary font used on the website was designed by Raphaël Ronot and is exclusively offered through the open and independant [Velvetyne](https://www.velvetyne.fr/) type foundry.  -->
The Unicode character on each page and the story around it comes from the excellent [decodeunicode](https://www.decodeunicode.org/) project.

The website is mainly using the [Jost*](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html) font from Indestructible type and [Fanwood Text](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fanwood) from the league of moveable type, both free and open source fonts. Oh, we’re also using [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) when it comes to code, designed by Rune B which is also free and open source.
