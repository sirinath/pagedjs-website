Paged.js logo was designed by [Anton Moglia](http://moglia.fr/) and [Julie Blanc](http://julie-blanc.fr) in a train back from [Les Rencontres de Lure](http://delure.org). Minipax, the extraordinary font used on the website was designed by RaphaÃ«l Ronot and is exclusively offered through [Velvetyne](https://www.velvetyne.fr/) type foundry. Paged.js website was designed and built by Julien Taquet thanks to the amazing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static website generator. Paged.js is maintained by the nice folks of the [Cabbage Tree Labs](https://www.cabbagetreelabs.org)
