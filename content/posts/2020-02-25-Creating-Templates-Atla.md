intro: >
    The nice folks of Atla Open Press have been working with Coko to develop their new publishing workflow around the amazing [Editoria](https://www.editoria.pub), which was the first publishing tool to offer Paged.js. So we helped them designing their new template.

Established in 1946 as the American Theological Library Association, 

Atla Open Press  specialized in books at the intersection of librarianship, religious and theological studies and Open Access. 

Let’s build an open source template!

## The object

The primary form of the books published by Atla are digital: epub and PDF made for the screen, downloadable from their website. But they also come as printed material, using Print On Demand services, or using reader home printer. Since that we can’t have a complete control over the final output of the book, we decided to stick to simple 6 × 9 inches. If someone needs to print it at home, they’ll be able to put 4 pages per sheet of paper, at almost the exact print size, reducing the waste.

What happens next is never a nice and easy sequence of steps that we can follow but a series of paths that are travelled together: we need to figure out the amount of characters we’ll be able to put on a page. To do so, we’ll go through a matrix of choices: the typeface(s), the font-size/leading, and the margins.

### Typefaces 

Typesetting is the act of putting letters on paper in an way that gracefully mix legibility and aesthetics, in order to offer the best reading experience of a content.

The quest for the right family of letters start with the licence. Atla and Coko are generously offering the template to anyone who’d like to use it, so we won’t force people to buy a font. When we started to look at fonts, we found the nice [Brill](https://brill.com/page/1228?language=en) typeface, designed by the folks at [Tiro Typeworks](http://www.tiro.com/) and while it would have been a great choice, the end user licence agreement makes it pretty impossible in an open source project.

Thanksfully, over the last 20 years, there have been a lot of movement in the world of open source type foundries, and there is even a specific license, the SIL Open Font License (OFL), around since 2005. There are a lot of foundries out there, and a lot of distributors, who offer font hosting, or tool to build webfonts kits to self host.



So let’s see what we found on the road, and why we made our choices.

#### The letter forms

The overall goal is to define the amount of text we want on a page, as we’re building a template that will work for different books. 


The second step is to define the margins of the book.

When it comes to design

If you need to design a book template, the first thing you need to work on is the fonts you’ll choose to 



Will it be too bold? too shy? too obvious or too subtle? Too strict or too familiar. Choosing the best typeface for a project has to do with looking for the exact distance you want to bring between your content and your reader.

Description
    The Linguistics Pro font family is based on the Utopia Nova font family, issued by Andreas Nolda, copyright(c) 2015, under the SIL Open Font License (OFL), version 1.1; see at http://scripts.sil.org/ofl. Compare to Utopia Nova the encoding in the Linguistics Pro font family is completely rearranged, there are changes in the form of some glyphs, new glyphs are added. The Linguistics Pro font family contains two models of cyrillic glyphs. The base range of the cyrillic glyphs (uni0410:uni044F) represents the modern Bulgarian letterform model. The traditional cyrillic letterform model is included as a local feature for Russian language and as a Stylistic Set 01. Stylistic Set 02 is for writting Serbian and Macedonian texts (in Regular and Bold variants) and for writting only Serbian texts in Italic and Bold Italic variants. Stylistic Set 03 is for writting Macedonian texts (in Italic and Bold variants).

Letters are the smallest bit of interface between a text and those who’re gonna look at it.
