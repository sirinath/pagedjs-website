## New release!

The 0.1.40 is now available to download from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pagedjs) (and on our [release page](/documentation/releases)).

In this release:

- @julientaq added support for the `position: fixed` property: if one of your element is set as `fixed`, it will be repeated on all pages without having to struggle with `margin-boxes`, `position: running` or `string-set`. Be aware that the origin  will always be the page, thus you’ll need to set up negative margins to your element to bring it in the bleeds.
- Antonio Norman (@antman3351) [found a bug and its fix](https://gitlab.pagedmedia.org/tools/pagedjs/issues/180), when you had multiple `string` elements on the same page.
- Support for period in `id` attribute: `.` is for `class` and `#` is for `id`. But the specs allow you to use a `.` in an `id`!
Paged.js can now handle `<p id="#this.paragraph">` without crashing.
- @Stouffi fixed a couple of bugs in the chunker, and documented those quite well [here](https://gitlab.pagedmedia.org/tools/pagedjs/merge_requests/101) and [there]https://gitlab.pagedmedia.org/tools/pagedjs/merge_requests/98).
- Fred Chasen (@fchasen) update the Jest infrastructure so tests are now running fine.
- Guillaume (@mogztter) wanted to be sure that we’d all follow the best practices without having to spend hours checking our spaces/tabs issues, so he set up eslint, put is hands in 58 files, cleaned all the tabulation issues we had in the code and updated.

Thanks to our awesome contributors you can now enjoy this new version.

See you all very soon!
