Paged.js is back folks, happy new year!

It’s been quite some time since we haven’t spoke, but truth is, we got a little bit busy to bring paged.js to new heights!

First, we are now under the flag of the Cabbage Tree Labs,next to amazing projects: Wax, the word processing engine for the web, and Xsweet, the Microsoft .docx format to HTML converter. All of these tools are open source, under MIT licence, and you should definitely check what you can do if you use those together (you can check Editoria, which now takes everything from those three tools to make books in the same app!)

And that’s just the beginning: as we’re writing these words, we’re polishing the paperworks to be members of the W3C, to finally take part of the conversation regarding web design for print with HTML and CSS. We’ll be more involved in the future of the specifications for print, and we’ll do what we need to make those go the road we want.


As a good first move, Julie is writing down some specifications for side and margin notes, that we’d like to discuss with everyone involved. 


Each of those can be used in any publishing workflow.

There has been quite a lot of content on the pagedmedia.org website, but most of it bein’ related to paged.js we’ll update those and reupdate them once in a while. 

We also now have a nice and usable documentation. For the last year, we’ve been writing scripts and plugins for Paged.js in order to do specific things: table of contents, footnotes, fullpage images, spreads, etc. A lot of those comes from the community, and are part of the gitlab demo repo. But we believe that there should be a place to keep those up to date, and this website will be it.

We also want to show all the goods that people using paged.js are doing: [Atla](https://www.atla.com) are now using Editoria as their only tool to manage workflow and editing, and are using Paged.js to generate their PDF. And since the folks behind Atla have a high idea of what Open Source means, they want to share their book templates as open source.

Booksprints comissioned two designers to produce four CSS templates to be used with Paged.js. Agathe Baez and Manuel Vazquez worked closely with us to be able to produce good looking templates for Paged.js. Those are mainly  mainly to be used within Editoria, but the collection keeps growing, which is pretty amazing. 

Our french friends at C&F editions uses paged.js to publish their collection named “Intervention”. Using only open tools, they manage to build a whole book production workflow that end up and libraries and bookshops, as physical books and a digital ones. 




After two years of Paged.js, we’re also met great contributors around the place: Thomas Parisot, who gave quite some time to the project by helping us on the codebase, Guillaume Grossetie, who’s made a pretty impressive Asciidoc Paged.js plugin (make books out of asciidoc!).

From posters to interfaces, I’ve been designing user experiences for a decade, with a soft spot for books. If computers and networks are strongly asking “what is a book today?” I’d like to push the thinking further. And since I always like to do things in a different way, let’s turn off InDesign for a while and see where –and if– we’ll be stopped in the making of books.

Before we get back to regular articles about printing using web technologies, let’s take a bit of time to discuss what happened last year in paged.js world.
