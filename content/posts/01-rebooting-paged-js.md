Paged.js is back, happy new year!

Hello folks!

Before we get back to regular articles about printing using web technologies, let’s take a bit of time to discuss what happened last year in paged.js world.

First, we are now under the flag of the Cabbage Tree Labs,amonst the amazing projects Wax, (the word processing engine for the web), and Xsweet (the Microsoft docx format to HTML translator). 

Each of those can be used in any publishing workflow.

There has been quite a lot of content on the pagedmedia.org website, but most of it bein’ related to paged.js we’ll update those and reupdate them once in a while. 

We also now have a nice and usable documentation. For the last year, we’ve been writing scripts and plugins for Paged.js in order to do specific things: table of contents, footnotes, fullpage images, spreads, etc. A lot of those comes from the community, and are part of the gitlab demo repo. But we believe that there should be a place to keep those up to date, and this website will be it.

We also want to show all the goods that people using paged.js are doing: [Atla](https://www.atla.com) are now using Editoria as their only tool to manage workflow and editing, and are using Paged.js to generate their PDF. And since the folks behind Atla have a high idea of what Open Source means, they want to share their book templates as open source.

Our french friends at C&F editions uses paged.js to publish their collection named “Intervention”. Using only open tools, they manage to build a whole book production workflow that end up and libraries and bookshops, as physical books and a digital ones. 

As we’re writing those words, we’re now polishing the paperworks to be members of the W3C, to take part of the conversation regarding print design with HTML and CSS. As a good first move, Julie is writing down some specifications for side and margin notes, that we’d like to discuss with everyone involved.
