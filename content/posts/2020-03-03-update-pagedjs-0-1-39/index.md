    The `string` function second argument is now available in Paged.js giving superpowers to your running heads.
---


Last week, the update to Paged.js was release just before the `string` function update was merged. That mistake is now fixed and you can start using the second argument right away. For more informations about how to do it, you can check the [specifications from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/#using-named-strings) on how to set up running heads and repeating content in margin-boxesg using `string-set`. 

As always, you can download from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pagedjs). You can also get the files from our [release](/documentation/releases) page.
