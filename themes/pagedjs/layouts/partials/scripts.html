            // This has two disadvantages. First, it is much slower, so it
            // would be a bad idea to do this repeatedly. If you are going
            // to be repeatedly updating a filter it's much better to use
            // the <canvas> tag directly. Second, this requires that the
            // image is hosted on the same domain as the script because
            // JavaScript has direct access to the image contents. When the
            // two tags were swapped using the previous method, JavaScript
            // actually doesn't have access to the image contents and this
            // does not violate the same origin policy.
